- Be smarter about "tell bob . foo" (i.e. sometimes cull item 3)
- personal "whois"/"rmhost" should work with CHANGE
- Keepalive pings?
- If you send it garbage in msg, it should trigger confused
- "tell" should check to see if the user is in the channel, and if not, only really send if it's in msg
- Detailed help on syntax fuckup in /msg?
- rmhost for own user (and, obviously, whois for own user)
- rmuser
- config file
  - change ticker?
- calc linking?
- Lock down chperm to GOD
- Figure out details of all the tables, document better
- Re-read the flood limiting system, make sure it's sane

-- Thoughts

If the user is IGNORE, we ignore them.

Next, if the command doesn't exist, we get confused.


verbal 1, parse 1, permissions 1: work
verbal 1, parse 0, permissions 1: confused
verbal 1, parse 1, permissions 0: permission
verbal 1, parse 0, permissions 0: permission

verbal 0, parse 1, permissions 1: work
verbal 0, parse 0, permissions 1: silent
verbal 0, parse 1, permissions 0: permission
verbal 0, parse 0, permissions 0: silent

(
Next we try parsing. If parsing fails, we either return confused or silently fail.

Next we check permissions. If permissions fail, we return an appropriate error.
(This includes the PUBLIC USER check.)
) this is wrong

Finally we actually dispatch.
