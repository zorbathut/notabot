---- Main path
- New parsing system
  - If you send it garbage in msg, it should trigger confused
- Notify Zorba on errors
- "tell" should check to see if the user is in the channel, and if not, only really send if it's in msg
- Detailed help on syntax fuckup in /msg?
- rmhost for own user (and, obviously, whois for own user)
- rmuser
- Better feedback for "change complete"
- config file
  - change ticker?
- calc linking?
- Lock down chperm to GOD
- Is "current" NULL allowed?
- Figure out details of all the tables, document better
- PHP interface

---- Is this ever needed?
- chversion?
- %%%BRAG%%%




------ Notes on new parsing and capabilities
USER can't ever talk in public - trying to use a command in public (that they have perms for) sends the standard "hay go talk in msg dudez" reply

values:
target - where was the command sent?
user_host - what is the hostmask of the user?
user_nick - what is the nick of the user?
permission - what permission level does the user have?

variables, may or may not exist:
key
value
text
command
version
user
hostmask
level

calc <key>  # context, permission
apropos <text>  # context
aproposk <text>  # context
aproposv <text>  # context
status [<key>]  # context, permission
help [<command>]  # context
more
version <version> <key> (in public, show nick - otherwise, show hostmask)
owncalc <key>
(PUBLIC only)
tell <user> <key> (ignore unless user_in_channel or sent_in_message)
(CHANGE only)
mkcalc <key> = <value>
rmcalc <key>
chcalc <key> = <value>
(GOD only)
addhost <user> <hostmask>
rmhost <user> <hostmask>
whois <user>
chperm <user> <level>
match <hostmask>

if it doesn't match any of these, in /msg, prompt. otherwise just ignore.
add more regexps for errors (mkcalc, rmcalc, chcalc)
