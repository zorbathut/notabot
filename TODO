---- Main path
- New parsing system
  - Regexp matching
  - "more blah blah blah blah" no trigger
  - If you send it garbage in msg, it should trigger confused
  - "version blah blah blah" no trigger
  - change showhost to whois
  - "addhost host" default to user
- rmhost for own user (and, obviously, whois for own user)
- rmuser
- Better feedback for "change complete"
- config file
  - change ticker?
- calc linking?
- Lock down chperm to GOD
- Is "current" NULL allowed?
- Figure out details of all the tables, document better
- PHP interface

---- Is this ever needed?
- chversion?
- %%%BRAG%%%




------ Notes on new parsing and capabilities
USER can't ever talk in public - trying to use a command in public (that they have perms for) sends the standard "hay go talk in msg dudez" reply

calc <key>
apropos <text>
aproposk <text>
aproposv <text>
status [<key>]
help [<command>]
more
version <version> <key> (in public, show nick - otherwise, show hostmask)
owncalc <key>
(PUBLIC only)
tell <user> <key> (ignore unless user_in_channel or sent_in_message)
(CHANGE only)
mkcalc <key> = <value>
rmcalc <key>
chcalc <key> = <value>
(GOD only)
addhost <user> <hostmask>
rmhost <user> <hostmask>
whois <user>
chperm <user> <level>
match <hostmask>
