-- Thoughts

If the user is IGNORE, we ignore them.

Next, if the command doesn't exist, we get confused.


verbal 1, parse 1, permissions 1: work
verbal 1, parse 0, permissions 1: confused
verbal 1, parse 1, permissions 0: permission
verbal 1, parse 0, permissions 0: permission

verbal 0, parse 1, permissions 1: work
verbal 0, parse 0, permissions 1: silent
verbal 0, parse 1, permissions 0: permission
verbal 0, parse 0, permissions 0: silent

(
Next we try parsing. If parsing fails, we either return confused or silently fail.

Next we check permissions. If permissions fail, we return an appropriate error.
(This includes the PUBLIC USER check.)
) this is wrong

Finally we actually dispatch.
